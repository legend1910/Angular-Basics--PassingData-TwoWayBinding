<h4>Event Binding,Passing Value and Two Way Binding</h4>
<h3>1.Event Binding</h3>
<!-- Like property binding uses [] Event binding uses ()-->
<!--we can use onclick event for typical JavaScript but here we are using (click)-->
<!-- Should not put too much logic within the quotes i.e(click)="" .You can return boolean values too -->
<button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="OnAddEmployee()" >Add Employee</button>
<p>{{AlertMessage}}<p>


<h3>2.Event Binding</h3>
<!-- $ is  reserve  variable which can be used inside the template and the value can be used withing the "" i.e (input)="OnNewEmployeeAdd($event)"-->
<!-- $event is a data emitted along with event where (input) and (click)  are html DOM Elements
  1. you can pass this $event to the function calling
  2. you can use this value between the quotes i.e (input)="OnNewEmployeeAdd($event)"
-->
<input type="text" (input)="OnNewEmployeeAdd($event)">
<p>{{ShowValue}}<p>
